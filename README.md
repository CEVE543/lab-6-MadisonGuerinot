# Lab 7: Model Implementation and Testing

**Date:** October 17, 2025 | **Module:** 2 | **Week:** 9

## Overview

This lab introduces students to hydrological model implementation by coding conceptual snowmelt-runoff models and implementing proper testing strategies. Students will translate physical processes into computational algorithms and establish validation approaches for model calibration.

## Topics Covered

- Hydrological model implementation and structure
- Time-stepping algorithms and mass balance preservation
- Model testing and validation strategies
- Foundation for Bayesian calibration exercises
- Error checking and debugging hydrological models

## Objectives

- Implement hydrological model time-stepping algorithms
- Code the run_hydromodel function with proper structure
- Test model implementation and validate results
- Establish foundation for calibration exercises

## Connection to Problem Sets

This lab builds the hydrological model implementation skills that students will need for PS2 Task 1 (implementing and testing the snowmelt-runoff model), providing the foundation for subsequent calibration and uncertainty analysis.
